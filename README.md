# Tableau_Airbnb_project

Analyzed a large Airbnb dataset ( 3000+ listings ) to identify key trends in pricing, revenue, and listing characteristics across the city.

Developed an interactive Tableau dashboard visualizing average price by zipcode, average price per zipcode, annual revenue for hotels, average price per bedroom, and the distinct count of bedroom listings, enabling users to explore market dynamics at a granular level.

Identified significant price variations across zipcodes, with a clear correlation between proximity to downtown and higher average listing prices. This insight could be used by Airbnb to optimize pricing recommendations for hosts.
